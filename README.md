# Final Project 
College project built Using C Language

This final project is done to fulfill the assignment for the "Programming" course. 
This final project is also referred to as the Big Challenge project which is equivalent to the final semester exam. 
The project is to create a program in a modular form that can read data from a text file, change word characters to lower case, score words based on a certain scoring method, collect words with the same score in alphabetical order, and sort scores words from largest to smallest (descending order). 
The sorting results are then stored in a binary file with a certain order. 
Then the program must also be able to display a maximum of n words with the highest score on the monitor screen. 
The value of n is input by the user via the keyboard.
